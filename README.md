# Silverplate - Simple React Redux boilerplate


Silverplate is a simple react-redux starter kit (boilerplate) which let's you build rich real world apps.


# Getting started

1. Clone the repository, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

3. Then open your [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the included small users app.

4. For more productivity you can install Chrome's [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)


# Why use this?

Silverplate contains the minimum npm packages you need to have installed in order to build a react redux real-world app containing:
* a proper file/folder structure
* pages (routes)
* forms with validation
* real-world API asynchronous requests
* unit tests
* bootstrap react components
* sass
* hot loader for ease of development
* redux tools
* js and css bundle files built for development or production

The code and implementation are minimal, which lets you focus on the real app, not the webpack, babel, gulp etc boilerplate files, which honestly you shouldn't even bother with.

# Sample app

Redux-Minimal also contains a small sample app that let's you manage some users with the following features:
* a list of users with pagination
* add a new user
* edit an existing user
* delete a user

The sample app provides you with basically most of the things you will need when building a new real-world app.

The demo for the app can be found here:
[http://redux-minimal-app.catalin-luntraru.com](http://redux-minimal-app.catalin-luntraru.com)


# Build your own app

1. Open `webpack.config.js` and change the `app_root` value from `src_users` to `src`

2. Run `npm start`

3. Congratulations! You now have a blank `Hello world` starting app


# Scripts

Besides the `start` script, there are also other scripts

|`npm run <script>`|What it does|
|------------------|------------|
|`start`|Starts the app at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). The bundle js/css files are stored in memory|
|`test`|Starts the unit testing using all the files found in the `test` folder|
|`test-watch`| Starts the unit testing and watches for changes to re-run the tests|
|`build-dev`|Builds the js/css bundle files in the `public` folder. Adds debugging code for development|
|`build-prod`|Builds the js/css bundle minified files in the `public` folder|
